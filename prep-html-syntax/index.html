  <h1 style="color:maroon;"> My favorite character in the Star Wars universe is Obi Wan Kenobi</h1>
  <img src="Obi-Wan.jpeg" alt="Picture of Obi Wan" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
  <p style="color:maroon;"> He is wise and fierce, but also patient and loving. He is not perfect, but all tried his
